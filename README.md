This paper aims at **dealing with GAN-inference artifacts**.
<br>

We design a method to effectively detect regions with GAN-inference artifacts, and further propose a fine-tuning strategy that only requires a small number of artifact
images to eliminate the same kinds of artifacts, which bridges the gap of applying SR algorithms to practical scenarios.
